          <h3>The beginning of the Operating System</h3>
          <p>Valeo24 proposed the idea of collaboration between ScreamingQQ originally. ScreamingQQ agreed to take on the job and then they started the large and taxing project. Currently right now the OS is being developed. Version 1.0 alpha is currently out in the GalacticTeamStudio. </p>

          <h3>Is Galactic OS affiliated with OS Wars?</h3>
          <p>Sadly we are not affiliated with OS Wars. We might join in the battle OS Wars in the future but we were too late to start in OS Wars X.  If we have any supporters for us entering in OS Wars XI, then we will consider the opportunity, but for now we are currently building up the ultimate team.</p>
