          <p>Valeo24 proposed the idea of collaboration between ScreamingQQ originally. ScreamingQQ agreed to take on the job and then they started the large and taxing project. Currently right now the OS is being developed. Version 1.0 alpha is currently out in the GalacticTeamStudio. </p>

          <h3>Is Galactic OS affiliated with OS Wars?</h3>
          <p>Sadly we are not affiliated with OS Wars. We might join in the battle OS Wars in the future but we were too late to start in OS Wars X.  If we have any supporters for us entering in OS Wars XI, then we will consider the opportunity, but for now we are currently building up the ultimate team.</p>

      <h1>What is Galactic OS?
</h1>
      <p>Galactic OS is an innovative and exciting new operating system that has been developed on the Scratch platform at Scratch.mit.edu. This groundbreaking OS is designed to provide users with a unique and engaging experience, combining elements of gaming, education, and creativity in a single, user-friendly package.
<br><br>
        One of the key features of Galactic OS is its stunning graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI has been designed with a sleek, modern aesthetic that is both visually appealing and intuitive to use. The home screen displays a range of colorful icons, each representing a different application or feature of the OS. These icons are neatly organized into categories, making it easy for users to find what they are looking for.
        <br><br>
        Another major strength of Galactic OS is its extensive library of built-in applications. These apps cover a wide range of categories, including games, educational tools, multimedia software, and productivity tools. Whether you're looking to play your favorite games, learn a new skill, or get work done, Galactic OS has you covered.
        <br><br>
        One of the most popular categories of apps on Galactic OS is the gaming section. Here, users will find a wide variety of games to choose from, ranging from simple puzzle games to more complex action and adventure titles. Many of these games have been developed using Scratch, which means that they are fully customizable and can be modified by users to create their own unique versions.
        <br><br>
        Another category of apps that is sure to be popular with users is the educational section. This section includes a range of tools and resources designed to help users learn new skills and expand their knowledge. For example, there are apps that teach users how to code, how to create art and music, and how to solve math and science problems. These apps are fun, engaging, and highly interactive, making learning a breeze.
        <br><br>
        In addition to its built-in apps, Galactic OS also supports third-party apps. This means that users can download and install apps created by other Scratch users, further expanding the capabilities of the OS. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities, as users can access a wide range of apps that have been developed by a diverse community of creators.
        <br><br>
        Another key feature of Galactic OS is its robust security system. The OS includes a range of measures to protect users from viruses, malware, and other online threats. For example, all apps are scanned for viruses before they are added to the app library, and users are prompted to install updates and security patches as soon as they become available.
        <br><br>
        Galactic OS also includes a range of tools and features designed to help users stay organized and productive. For example, the OS includes a calendar app, which allows users to schedule appointments, set reminders, and keep track of important dates. There is also a task manager app, which allows users to create to-do lists, set priorities, and track their progress.
        <br><br>
        In addition to its productivity tools, Galactic OS also includes a range of multimedia software. For example, there is a music player app, which allows users to listen to their favorite songs and create playlists. There is also a video player app, which supports a wide range of video formats, including MP4, AVI, and WMV.
        <br><br>
        Another major strength of Galactic OS is its support for online collaboration. The OS includes a range of tools and features designed to help users work together on projects, no matter where they are in the world. For example, there is a chat app, which allows users to send messages in real-time. 
        <br><br>
        Galactic OS is also highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the OS to their own preferences and needs. For example, users can change the wallpaper and theme of the OS, as well as the layout and arrangement of the icons on the home screen. Users can also create their own apps and add them to the app library, further expanding the capabilities of the OS.
        <br><br>
        Another key feature of Galactic OS is its support for offline use. The OS includes a range of apps and tools that can be used even when an internet connection is not available. For example, there are games that can be played offline, as well as educational tools and productivity apps. This makes Galactic OS a great choice for users who need to be able to work and play on the go, without always having access to an internet connection.
        <br><br>
        In addition to its many features and capabilities, Galactic OS is also highly accessible. The OS has been designed with a wide range of users in mind, including those with disabilities. For example, the OS includes a range of accessibility features, such as text-to-speech functionality, keyboard shortcuts, and support for assistive technologies.
        <br><br>
        Another major strength of Galactic OS is its strong community of users. The Scratch platform, where the OS was developed, is home to a large and active community of creators and innovators. This community is a great resource for users of Galactic OS, as they can access a wealth of knowledge, advice, and support from other members.
        <br><br>
        One of the most exciting aspects of Galactic OS is its potential for future development. The Scratch platform is constantly evolving, and new features and capabilities are being added all the time. This means that users of Galactic OS can look forward to a steady stream of updates and improvements in the future.
        <br><br>
        In conclusion, Galactic OS is a powerful and versatile operating system that offers users a unique and engaging experience. With its stunning graphical user interface, extensive library of built-in apps, robust security system, and support for third-party apps, Galactic OS is a great choice for users who want a high-quality, feature-rich operating system that is both fun and functional.</p>
